class WelcomeController < ApplicationController

    def home
    end

end

# - I decided to make a home/landing page after seeing Wilson's awesome post in the Night Benders channel. 

# - A welcome controller was generated "rails g controller Welcome", and in views/welcome, a home.html.erb was created.

# - As a user or client, I want the functionality of a homepage so I can easily navigate the pages. -->
