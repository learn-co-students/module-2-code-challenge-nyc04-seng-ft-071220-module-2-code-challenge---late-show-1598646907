<!-- Do not use buttons! I added these link_tos for a better user experience. -->

<!-- As a user, I want to easily navigate through the pages. -->

<ul>
  <% @episodes.each do |episode| %>
    <li> <%= "Episode #{episode.number} - #{episode.date.strftime("%B %d, %Y")}"%></li>

<!-- How do I link to every episode and date? That's a functionality I really want to implement! -->

<!-- From the README:

## What You Already Have

The starter code includes migrations, models, and seed data for Guests and Episodes. 
There are also routes, controller actions, and views to support listing the guests and episodes.

After running the setup instructions above, visiting `'/guests'` will display all of the guests, 
and visiting `'/episodes'` will display all of the episodes. -->
